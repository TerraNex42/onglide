    If you would like a competition hosted please email your soaring spot keys to melissa-ogn@onglide.com and I can set it up for you.

  <p>
    Onglide automatically fetches tasks, pilots and scores from your scoring system (SoaringSpot and RST are currently supported). <br/>
    It tracks gliders with tracking sent to OGN, and scores them against the task (AAT, DH and Speed Tasks). It attempts to adjust distances to handicaps, currently using ONLY the UK system (if UK scoring script will include windicapping)<br/>
    It only displays gliders in the competition, matching them using the OGN DDB or if that isn't possible it will use the launch/landing times from igc files<br/>
    It shouldn't require any administration from the competition, though if tracker IDs are wrong I'm happy to fix them manually.<br/>
